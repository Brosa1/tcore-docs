# Install Plugin Manually

Maybe you are developing a Plugin or maybe you have received a bundled plugin from someone and you want to install it manually. In either case, to install a 
plugin manually you have two choices:

## Install via the sidebar

TagoCore's sidebar allows you to quickly install a bundled (.tcore) plugin file. Look for the &nbsp;<img src="/docs/img/icons/puzzle-piece.svg" width="15px"/>&nbsp; button in the sidebar and click it.

:::info
This option designed to load bundled (.tcore) files. If you have a simple Node.js project, go to the next option.
::: 

## Add to the Plugin Folder

If your plugin is not bundled, you need to add its Node.js project to the `Plugin Folder` defined in your TagoCore's settings. After adding the project in that folder, simply restart TagoCore and your Plugin will be loaded.
