# Installation

Now that you have downloaded TagoCore, you must launch it to set it up. Open a terminal in the folder where you download TagoCore and execute the file:

```shell
./tagocore
```

As soon as TagoCore first runs, it will open a webserver and log the URL of the server in the terminal:

```shell
TagoCore is now available at http://localhost:8888
```

To complete the installation, access the URL in your browser and follow the instructions.
